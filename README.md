# Blue Archive OS
Blue Archive OS is a Arch based Linux Distro that uh.. you can install :D

> [!WARNING]  
> Blue Archive OS is in early development and configuration, it is NOT reccomended to install this onto your disk, especially since there may be breaking changes in the future as we put everything together.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> There is currently no installer application to fully install baOS for you however you can treat the live ISO like a regular arch ISO and install it yourself.

I should also note that im not the best linux dev, im still learning how to do all of this and putting this source and getting it all right today was a bit of a challenge, especially when building. On that note feel free to open pull requests and issues if you want to help me <3

I am also not entirely sure if I should call this a "Distro" or just "Arch but customised" and where im supposed to credit people's packages such as the Arona SDDM theme I got off the internet.. so yeah if you can educate me on all of this that would be appriciated, ill do my own research too obviously but yeah feel free to open PR's and issues :D

Suggestions are also welcome<3

## Building from source
Feel free to clone/fork this repo for your own needs. Follow [this](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Archiso#Build_the_ISO) guide to build the ISO from source and/or customise the archiso.

> [!WARNING]  
> `mkarchiso` will use ALL your computer resources, it is reccomended to build the ISO in the tty otherwise your DE and kernel may lock up to the point where a REISUB is needed. A beefy computer may avoid this issue however.
